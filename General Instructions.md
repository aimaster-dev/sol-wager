Enter the amount of SOL to deposit
Confirm the transaction
You'll receive 100 YES and 100 NO tokens per 1 SOL deposited

Trading Tokens

Click "Claim Winnings"
Winning tokens will be redeemed for 0.01 SOL each

Development Roadmap
Phase 1: MVP (Current)

Basic platform with proposition creation
Decentralized orderbook with partial fills
Platform authority resolving wagers

Phase 2: Enhanced Resolution

Multi-validator consensus mechanism
Integration with oracles for automated resolution
Support for more complex proposition types

Phase 3: Advanced Features

Liquidity pools and automated market making
Mobile application
Advanced analytics and visualization tools
DAO governance for platform parameters

Technical Considerations
Security

All smart contracts use Anchor's security patterns
Critical operations require proper authorization
Funds are secured in PDA-controlled vaults
Time-bound operations prevent premature resolution

Scalability

Leverages Solana's high-throughput blockchain
Optimized account data structures
Efficient order matching algorithm
Pagination for order history and wager listings

Economic Incentives

Platform fees fund ongoing development
Market-driven odds based on order flow
Equal initial distribution of YES/NO tokens ensures market neutrality

echo "All files for General Wager Bet have been created successfully in the wagers.bet folder."

This command will create all the necessary files for your General Wager Bet platform in your wagers.bet folder. The command is a bash script that:

1. Creates the directory structure
2. Creates the core Solana program in Rust
3. Creates the TypeScript client library
4. Creates the React frontend components
5. Creates a comprehensive README
6. Creates the Anchor configuration file

After running this command, you'll need to:

1. Install dependencies for both the Rust program and the React app
2. Build and deploy the Solana program using Anchor
3. Update the program ID if necessary
4. Start the frontend development server

The implementation includes all the features you requested, including the pooled orderbook where orders can be partially or completely filled. The platform deployer serves as the wager resolver for now, as specified in your requirements.
