## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Information Problem

In an increasingly complex world, accurate forecasting has become critical for decision-making across all sectors. Traditional polling, expert opinions, and analytical models often fail to capture the nuanced, real-time sentiment of informed participants. Prediction markets solve this by creating financial incentives for accurate information aggregation.

### 1.2 The Access Problem

Current prediction markets suffer from two critical limitations:
1. **Centralized Gatekeeping**: Platforms decide which markets to create
2. **Limited Coverage**: Many niche but valuable predictions go unmade

Wagers.bet solves both problems by enabling permissionless market creation on any topic, from global elections to local weather patterns, from product launches to scientific discoveries.

### 1.3 Our Solution

Wagers.bet is a fully decentralized prediction market protocol built on Solana that allows anyone to:
- Create markets on any binary outcome
- Trade positions through an automated order book
- Benefit from accurate predictions
- Earn from market creation and liquidity provision
